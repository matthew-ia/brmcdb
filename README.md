# brmcdb
Blue Ridge Music Center database project

1. BRMCDB - Event/Weather Info
------------------------------
For this part of the project, I implemented the retrieval of certain entity attributes for events and weather conditions in   PHP. 
    
2. BRMCDB -  Update/Add Entry Locations
---------------------------------------
In this part I retrieved the values of an entity's particular attribute, and allowed the user to update or add new values for that attribute.
